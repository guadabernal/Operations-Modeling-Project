The controls for creating a directed graph:

    directed-graph.c

    directed-graph.h



Each Algorithm has its own files:

    nearest-neighbor.c

    nearest-neighbor.h



Algorithms to be implemented: ( in progress )

    Nearest Neighbor Heuristic:

        Returns list of edges that make up the shortest path

    Dijkstra's Algorithm:

        Returns list of edges that make up the shortest path tree from

    Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm:
